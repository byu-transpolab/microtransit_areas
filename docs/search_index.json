Under this partnership, UTA has supplemented its fixed-route services with on-demand shuttles hailed through a mobile application. So-called “microtransit” offerings of this kind have the potential to efficiently extend UTA services into low-density areas and function as first- and last-mile services for the regular fixed-route rail and bus network. The current microtransit service is currently only operating in southern Salt Lake County (Utah Transit Authority 2021). UTA is interested in examining if there are other areas where similar services can be effectively deployed. In September 2020, UTA released a report detailing a possible expansion of microtransit services to other areas in Utah following the UTA on Demand pilot program (Robertson, Callison, and Taylor 2020). 19 zones were identified between Brigham City and Santaquin as areas that could potentially benefit from microtransit services. Ridership was estimated based on number of residents and number of workers employed within each zone, as well as a mode share score that VIA developed based on their internal demand model. We seek however to provide UTA and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) with a microsimulation model they can use as a template to examine future similar projects. We want to know how the results of such a model would compare to those of UTA’s September 2020 report. Though UTA’s own report made no definitive recommendations regarding expansion of microtransit services, it may be useful in calibrating our simulation. We also seek to use our results (possibly in conjunction with those of UTA’s report) to make recommendations to UTA and UDOT regarding expansion of microtransit services.

This model is being developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the UC Berkeley Institute for Transportation Studies, and is an extension to the MATSim (Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation) model. BEAM is an agent-based simulation that allows agents to dynamically adjust their plans, including mode choice, depending on the current state of the mobility simulation (The BEAM Team 2017). The version of the BEAM code we used is available at &lt;insert commit ID or other reference to the code&gt;. We identified &lt;some number of&gt; potential areas to expand ridehail services to, and created BEAM scenarios incorporating each of these areas. We also created a base scenario for the current system. We ran each scenario with the same parameters, and for 15 iterations each.1 BEAM outputs an events file, which we then used to perform our analysis. We compared the different scenarios on several metrics, including weekday ridership, utilization (passengers/hour/vehicle), wait time, and travel time. We also compared the base scenario to the results of UTA’s September 2020 report (Robertson, Callison, and Taylor 2020). The results of that report used many qualitative metrics, but some quantitative metrics of interest were average ridership, wait time, and utilization. These results of the report are presented in 2.1 below.

Much of the data in that report, however, is not necessarily representative, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its onset in lat March 2020. We also figured the data for December was not particularly valuable: since the service was new, people who would otherwise have used it may not have been accustomed to or even known about it. We therefore decided to use the average of the data from January through March. The comparison is given in 3.1. Table 3.1: Comparison of Actual Pilot Program Data with Simulated Base Scenario Scenario Total Ridership Average Wait Time (minutes) Utilization\\(^{\\text{a}}\\) South SL County only 1006.00 5.82 4.14 UTA Report Average Jan–Mar 347.33 11.33 2.06 a Utilization is calculated as passengers per hour per vehicle It is clear from this comparison that more calibration is required in order to better match the real-world data from the pilot program. There are several ways to adjust parameters and code in BEAM to achieve this calibration, and work is planned to continue on doing exactly that (though that is outside the scope of this report). However, it is encouraging to see that the simulated values are within an order of magnitude of the real-world values. Additionally, we calculated these and other metrics for our other scenarios, and compared them. These metrics are given in 3.2. Table 3.2: Comparison of Simulated Scenarios Scenario Total Ridership Ride Hail Trips Percent of RH Trips Average Wait Time (minutes) Utilization\\(^{\\text{a}}\\) South SL County only 1006 930 1.16 5.82 4.14 South SLC with Airport 1395 1328 1.66 5.37 2.87 South SLC/Airport/Sandy 2796 2473 3.08 5.77 3.84 South SLC/Airport/West Jordan 2620 2353 2.93 5.53 3.59 a Utilization is calculated as passengers per hour per vehicle These results seem to indicate that adding a ridehail zone near the airport would not have much of an effect, but adding a zone in either Sandy or West Jordan would. It’s possible that the airport zone was too small to be of much use, and there is already public transit to the airport, so adding a ridehail service wouldn’t provide much additional benefit. However, the other scenarios present a substantial increase in ridership, as well as percentage of trips involving a ridehail vehicle. Utilization in these scenarios on the other hand doesn’t seem to improve; it may be that the fleet size needs to be adjusted to better match the demand. Overall, these results seem to indicate that additional implementation of ridehail services would see good use, and should be seriously considered by UTA.
